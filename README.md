# 🔧 Components Used

•	2 × NE555 Timer IC
•	Red, Yellow, Green LEDs
•	100KΩ, 47KΩ, 330Ω, 180Ω resistors
•	100µF electrolytic capacitors
•	Jumper wires
•	Breadboard
•	5–9V power supply

# ⚡ Working Principle

The circuit uses two 555 timers:
Timer 1 – Red to Yellow transition
•	Controls the ON duration of the Red LED
•	When Timer 1 output falls, the Yellow LED is triggered
Timer 2 – Yellow to Green transition
•	Controls Yellow and Green timings
•	Completes the cycle and repeats continuously

Timing is defined by:
              T=0.693(R1+2R2)C

By changing resistor or capacitor values, you can adjust how long each LED stays ON.
